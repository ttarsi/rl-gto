This is a toy example of game theory optimal strategies. It shows an example game of a "balanced" player vs an aggressive one. By having a balanced strategy, the player is "unexploitable". So, no player (static, exploiter, or otherwise) will be able to exploit our player to win more than 50% of games. Any player who deviates from the balanced frequencies is predictable and therefore exploitable.
