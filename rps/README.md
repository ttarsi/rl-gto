It shows an example game of a balanced GTO player vs an aggressive one. By having a balanced range, the GTO player is "unexploitable". So, no player (static, exploiter, or otherwise) will be able to exploit our GTO player to win more than 50% of games. Any player who deviates from the GTO frequencies is predictable and therefore exploitable.
